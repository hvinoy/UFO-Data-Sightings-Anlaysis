Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.


Used a date form in HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
